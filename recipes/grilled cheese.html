    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Italian marinated grilled cheese is made by briefly marinating 3 kinds of cheese with a quick oil and vinegar dressing, and including a few things you typically find in antipasto. Itâ€™s a new and amazing twist on the classic grilled cheese sandwich.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Cheese Filling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch chili flakes</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon dried Italian herbs</li>
        <li>2 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, grated</li>
        <li>2 ounces Cheddar cheese, grated</li>
        <li>1 slice provolone, quartered</li>
        <li>1 rounded tablespoon diced roasted red peppers</li>
        <li>1 rounded tablespoon diced pickled pepperoncini peppers</li>
        <li>1 rounded tablespoon diced green olives</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Sandwich</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 thick slices French bread</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk garlic, vinegar, olive oil, black pepper, chili flakes, and herbs together in a bowl; stir in Monterey Jack, Cheddar, and provolone cheeses until combined.</li>
        <li>Stir in red peppers, pepperoncini, and olives. Wrap and let marinade in fridge for 15 minutes, or up to several hours.</li>
        <li>Pile the marinated cheese, beginning with the provolone, evenly onto 1 bread slice; cover with the other slice. Heat olive oil in a nonstick pan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Fry sandwich until both sides are crisp and well-browned, and cheese filling has melted, about 3 minutes per side.</li>
    </ol>
